    "summary": "The Pathfinder Framework Data Model allows for the interoperable exchange of product footprint data. This includes the productâ€™s carbon footprint, represented in the Data Model as a CarbonFootprint. Each CarbonFootprint is scoped by Geography, specified (at maximum resolution) as a ISO 3166-2 country subdivision. In some cases, the current resolution is insuficient and a more precise, hopefully plant-level, geographic specification would be recommended. The UN/LOCODE Data Model Extension aims at providing precisely the required level of granularity, using an international coding scheme that is public and can be integrated into solutions.",
